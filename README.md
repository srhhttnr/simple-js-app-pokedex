This project is a JavaScript application that creates an interactive list of Pokemon and their details. The information for each Pokemon is taken from the following API: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/?limit=150. The Pokemon are displayed as a list by their name, and then uses modal functionality to display their details once the user clicks on their name. The code is contained within an IIFE called pokemonRepository that holds all of the methods used to retrieve the data of each Pokemon and load it to the web page.
The addListItem() function creates an array of Pokemon (pokemonList) and displays them by name on the webpage as buttons. The loadList() function fetches the list of Pokemon from the API and parses the data into objects in the pokemonList array. The loadDetails() function fetches the details of each Pokemon, specifically an image of the Pokemon, their height weight, types, and abilities, and stores it within each object (Pokemon) in the pokemonList array. The showDetails() function displays each Pokemon from the array (and their details) in a modal once the user interacts with and clicks its button. 
The project uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, promise polyfill, fetch polyfill, ESLint, and Prettier.
